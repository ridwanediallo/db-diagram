# Clinic Database

A database system for managing a clinic operation flows including patients, treatments, medical histories, and medical invoices records.


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema_based_on_diagram.sql](./schema_based_on_diagram.sql) to create all tables.database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
